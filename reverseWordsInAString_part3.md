## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build": "react-scripts build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!

### `"npm run test": "react-scripts test"`,

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"serve": "node server"`

For running the server file on you can use this command.

### `npm run serve`

557. Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Example 2:

Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s contains printable ASCII characters.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
There is at least one word in s.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.


Approach #1 Simple Solution[Accepted]
The first method is really simple. We simply split up the given string based on whitespaces and put the individual words in an array of strings. Then, we reverse each individual string and concatenate the result. We return the result after removing the additional whitespaces at the end.

public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String words[] = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder res=new StringBuilder();
        for (String word: words)
            res.append(new StringBuffer(word).reverse().toString() + " ");
        return res.toString().trim();
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n)O(n). where nn is the length of the string.

Space complexity : O(n)O(n). resres of size nn is used.

Approach #2 Without using pre-defined split and reverse function [Accepted]
Algorithm

We can create our own split and reverse function. Split function splits the string based on the delimiter " "(space) and returns the array of words. Reverse function returns the string after reversing the characters.

public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String words[] = split(s);
        StringBuilder res=new StringBuilder();
        for (String word: words)
            res.append(reverse(word) + " ");
        return res.toString().trim();
    }
    public String[] split(String s) {
        ArrayList < String > words = new ArrayList < > ();
        StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                words.add(word.toString());
                word = new StringBuilder();
            } else
                word.append( s.charAt(i));
        }
        words.add(word.toString());
        return words.toArray(new String[words.size()]);
    }
    public String reverse(String s) {
      StringBuilder res=new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            res.insert(0,s.charAt(i));
        return res.toString();
    }
}

**Complexity Analysis**
Time complexity : O(n)O(n). where nn is the length of the string.
Space complexity : O(n)O(n). resres of size nn is used.

Approach #3 Using StringBuilder and reverse method [Accepted]
Algorithm

Instead of using split method, we can use temporary string wordword to store the word. We simply append the characters to the wordword until ' ' character is not found. On getting ' ' we append the reverse of the wordword to the resultant string resultresult. Also after completion of loop , we still have to append the reversereverse of the wordword(last word) to the resultresult string.

public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String input) {
        final StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        final StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            if (input.charAt(i) != ' ') {
                word.append(input.charAt(i));
            } else {
                result.append(word.reverse());
                result.append(" ");
                word.setLength(0);
            }
        }
        result.append(word.reverse());
        return result.toString();
    }
}

**Complexity Analysis**
Time complexity : O(n)O(n). Single loop upto nn is there, where nn is the length of the string.
Space complexity : O(n)O(n). resultresult and wordword size will grow upto nn.
